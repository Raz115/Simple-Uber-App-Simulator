# Simple-Uber-App-Simulator

Description
This is a project I worked on at TMU in my cps 209 class. This project simulates a simplified Uber-like app that manages users, drivers, and requests for rides and deliveries. 

Features Implemented:
- User and Driver Registration: Handles registering users and drivers in the system.
- Requesting Rides and Deliveries: Allows users to request rides and deliveries with drivers.
- Sorting and Management: Sorts users based on their name, wallet balance, and distance traveled.
- Error Handling: Detects invalid inputs like empty user names, insufficient funds, and unavailable drivers.

General Information:
- Run the program using java TMUberUI.
- Sample test scripts have been provided
